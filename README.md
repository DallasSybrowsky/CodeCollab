# CodeCollab

## Description
CodeCollab is a MERN Stack web application that allows developers to collaborate on coding projects. Users can create an account, create a new project, and invite collaborators to join their project. Once collaborators join the project, they can submit comments to communicate to the project owner and other project members.
